## THEORY
INTEGRATOR
A circuit in which the output voltage waveform is the integral of the input voltage waveform is the integrator. Such a circuit is obtained by using a basic inverting amplifier configuration if the feedback resistor Rf is replaced by a capacitor Cf . The expression for the output voltage is given as,
Vo = - (1/Rf C1 ) ∫ Vi dt

Here the negative sign indicates that the output voltage is 180 0 out of phase with the input signal. Normally between fa and fb the circuit acts as an integrator. Generally, the value of fa < fb . The input signal will be integrated properly if the Time period T of the signal is larger than or equal to Rf Cf . That is,
T ≥ Rf Cf

The integrator is most commonly used in analog computers and ADC and signal-wave shaping circuits.

## THEORY
DIFFEERENTIATOR:
The differentiator circuit performs the mathematical operation of differentiation; that is, the output waveform is the derivative of the input waveform. The differentiator may be constructed from a basic inverting amplifier if an input resistor R1 is replaced by a capacitor C1 . The expression for the output voltage is given as,
Vo = - Rf C1 ( dVi /dt )

Here the negative sign indicates that the output voltage is 180 0 out of phase with the input signal. A resistor Rcomp = Rf is normally connected to the non-inverting input terminal of the op-amp to compensate for the input bias current. A workable differentiator can be designed by implementing the following steps:
1.	Select fa equal to the highest frequency of the input signal to be differentiated. Then, assuming a value of C1 < 1 µF, calculate the value of Rf.
2.	Choose fb = 20 fa and calculate the values of R1 and Cf so that R1C1 = Rf Cf.

The differentiator is most commonly used in wave shaping circuits to detect high frequency components in an input signal and also as a rate–of–change detector in FM modulators.
